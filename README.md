## Problem Title: Smart Water Management System 
## Problem Description
Background: Water is one of our most precious resources, yet so much of it is wasted due to leaks, overuse, and inefficient management. This project aims to develop a smart water management system that helps people monitor their water usage, detect leaks early, and find ways to conserve water. By using IoT sensors, real-time tracking, and AI-based recommendations, the system will empower individuals and communities to make better decisions about their water consumption. The platform will also provide insights to municipalities to improve water distribution and reduce wastage. A reward system will encourage users to save water by offering incentives for lower consumption.

Ministry of Water Resources

## Idea
 1.Smart Water Usage Monitoring:
   A network of IoT sensors will track household and community water usage in real-time. Users will see their daily, weekly, and monthly consumption trends in a simple mobile app.

 2.Leak Detection & Instant Alerts:
   The system will detect unusual spikes in water usage, which could indicate a leak. If a leak is detected, an instant alert will be sent to the user, allowing them to take quick action.

 3.Personalized Water Conservation Tips:
   The app will analyze each user’s water consumption habits and suggest easy ways to save water—like taking shorter showers, fixing leaks, or using water-efficient appliances.

 4.Reward Points for Saving Water:
   To encourage conservation, users who successfully reduce their water usage will earn reward points. These points can be redeemed for discounts on their water bills or exchanged for eco-friendly products.

 5.Real-time Analytics for Government & Municipalities:
  A smart dashboard will provide authorities with real-time data on water usage, leak-prone areas, and high-consumption zones, helping them plan better water distribution and conservation strategies.

## Use Cases
Detecting Leaks Early: A user receives an alert about a possible leak in their home. They check their plumbing, find a faulty pipe, and fix it before the problem worsens—saving water and money.
Encouraging Water Conservation: A family reduces their water consumption by 15% after following app recommendations. They earn reward points, which they use for a discount on their next water bill.
Smart Alerts for Overuse: A user’s water usage spikes unexpectedly. They check the app and realize their garden irrigation system was left running overnight. They turn it off, preventing unnecessary wastage.
Government Insights: A city’s water department sees a sharp increase in water usage in a specific area. Using the dashboard, they identify the issue and take action, such as sending alerts to residents or adjusting supply.
Encouraging Eco-friendly Habits: The app suggests switching to low-flow showerheads or using rainwater harvesting techniques. Users follow these suggestions and see their water bills drop.
